## Code_SA

In the **`code_SA`** folder, you will find the source code of the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm we implemented from **[Tole et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2023.109004)**.

## Instances

The instances in the **``instances/existing``** folder are existing instances created by **[LÃ³pez and Beasley (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054818300509)** and **[Bouzid and
Salhi (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221720302149)**. The instances in the **``instances/new``** folder is newly dataset generated by us.

## Results

Folders **``results/CBPP-RI``** and **``results/SCPP-RI``** provide detailed results obtained by the GDILS for solving CBPP-RI and SCPP-RI, respectively. We have mentioned below something about the meaning of some columns in **``csv``** files:

- **Instance**: the name of a instance;
- **R**: the radius of circular container;
- **A**: the area of circular container;
- **A'**: the reduced area of circular container;
- **n**: the number of items;
- **RotateEnable**: the flag indicating whether the item can be rotated (F: cannot be rotated, R: can be rotated);
- **Opt**: the flag of whether the solution for the instance is optimal (0: not optimal, 1: optimal);
- **Gap**: the optimality gap between $LB$ and $UB$, calculated as $(UB-LB)/UB$;
- **LB_Area**: the valid lower bound $LB_{area}$;
- **LB_MT**: the valid lower bound $LB_{mt}$;
- **LB_Area_Imp**: the valid lower bound $LB_{area}'$;
- **LB_MT_Imp**: the valid lower bound $LB_{mt}'$;
- **LB_Best**: the best lower bound, computed as $\max \{LB_{area}',LB_{mt}'\}$;
- **UB0**: the number of bins used in the initial solution;
- **UB**: the number of bins used in the best found solution;
- **lbTime**: the time it takes to calculate lower bounds (unit: seconds);
- **ub0Time**: the time it takes to find the initial solution (unit: seconds);
- **incTime**: the time it takes to find the incumbent solution (unit: seconds);
- **totalTime**: the total time spent running GDILS (unit: seconds);
