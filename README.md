### Full reference: Sunkanghong Wang, Runqin Wang, Hao Zhang, Qiang Liu and Lijun Wei. (2024). A Goal-Driven Iterated Local Search Approach Based on the Maximal-Space Based Heuristic for the Circle Bin Packing Problem with Rectangular Items. Under revision.

This repository hosts the files backing up the data and experimental results described in our paper A Goal-Driven Iterated Local Search Approach Based on the Maximal-Space Based Heuristic for the Circle Bin Packing Problem with Rectangular Items referenced above. The paper is now under revision. A link to it will be provided as soon as possible.

## Instances

The instances in the ``instances/existing`` folder are existing instances created by [López and Beasley (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054818300509) and [Bouzid and
Salhi (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221720302149). The instances in the ``instances/new`` folder is newly dataset generated by us.

## Results

Folders ``results/CBPP-RI`` and ``results/SCPP-RI`` provide detailed results obtained by the GDILS for solving CBPP-RI and SCPP-RI, respectively. We have mentioned below something about the meaning of some columns in ``csv`` files:

- **Instance**: the name of a instance;
- **R**: the radius of circular container;
- **A**: the area of circular container;
- **A'**: the reduced area of circular container;
- **n**: the number of items;
- **RotateEnable**: the flag indicating whether the item can be rotated (F: cannot be rotated, R: can be rotated);
- **Opt**: the flag of whether the solution for the instance is optimal (0: not optimal, 1: optimal);
- **Gap**: the optimality gap between $LB$ and $UB$, calculated as $(UB-LB)/UB$;
- **LB_Area**: the valid lower bound $LB_{area}$;
- **LB_MT**: the valid lower bound $LB_{mt}$;
- **LB_Area_Imp**: the valid lower bound $LB_{area}'$;
- **LB_MT_Imp**: the valid lower bound $LB_{mt}'$;
- **LB_Best**: the best lower bound, computed as $\max \{LB_{area}',LB_{mt}'\}$;
- **UB0**: the number of bins used in the initial solution;
- **UB**: the number of bins used in the best found solution;
- **lbTime**: the time it takes to calculate lower bounds (unit: seconds);
- **ub0Time**: the time it takes to find the initial solution (unit: seconds);
- **incTime**: the time it takes to find the incumbent solution (unit: seconds);
- **totalTime**: the total time spent running GDILS (unit: seconds);
